# Kubernetes read-only service discovery policy
# allows Kubernetes to observe the Consul catalog, not participate in it.

service_prefix "" {
  policy = "read"
}

node_prefix "" {
  policy = "read"
}



## CURRENT setup
# K8s does NOT talk to Consul, has no Consul token, Consul is an implementation detail of Vault.
# So these policies are not used at all for the current setup.


## FUTURE CASE 1
# Consul clients on K8s nodes + Consul for service discovery
# Possibly Consul Connect / mesh

## FUTURE CASE 2
# A controller mirrors Consul services into K8s (non-K8s services registered in Consul like legacy VMs, external databases)
# Observability tooling correlates services ↔ nodes (any system that collects or correlates signals (metrics, logs, traces) across multiple domains.)
